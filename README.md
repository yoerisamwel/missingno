# missingno
Came across the missingno library. Made a couple of Jupiter notebooks to see how it works and what I can use it for at work.

Interesting libary to quickly visualize the blank fields in a dataset. I ran through a couple of datasets and believe it can be very usefull for datasets with dateranges (I mostly works with those) to see what dateranges are most affected by missing values. Allowing me to asses the potentional impact on a analysis relative fast.

Like the libary a lot and used it for quite large datasets at work. You do have to slice the dateset if you have multiple dateranges to make sure you can get a accurate picture. The visualizations are usefull for presentations.
